Data Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
---Sample Code----------	
	Select count(*) 
	From Attribute;
------------------------		
---This query is written for all tables---
	
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 	(id)
ii. Hours = 1562 	(business_id)
iii. Category =	2643    (business_id)
iv. Attribute =	1115	(business_id)
v. Review = 10000	(id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 	(business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000	(id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537	(user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 	(id)
x. Friend = 11	(user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780	(user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

---Sample Code----------
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
FROM business;
-------------------------
---This query is written for all tables---

	SELECT stars, SUM(review_count) AS count
	FROM business
	WHERE city == 'Beachwood'
	GROUP BY stars
  	ORDER BY stars DESC;

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns - star rating and count):

|   2.0 |     8 |
+-------+-------+		


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
		SELECT name, review_count
		FROM user
		ORDER BY review_count DESC
		LIMIT 3;
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:	
		+--------+--------------+
		| name   | review_count |
		+--------+--------------+
		| Gerald |         2000 |
		| Sara   |         1629 |
		| Yuri   |         1339 |
		+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

As the tables is shown in below reviews and fans do not necessarily have correlation. For example, Gerald posted 2000 reviews and has 253 fans while Mimi posted 968 reviews and she has 497 fans. 
By sorting the table by fans in descending order,it is observable to see that the users who have the highest number of fans might have fewer review_count than other users.

	SELECT name,id,fans,review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC;

+-----------+------+--------------+
| name      | fans | review_count |
+-----------+------+--------------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	I picked Toronto as a city and Pubs as a category. When I analyzed two groups that I chose, their distribution of hours is different than each others.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         Yes, their reviews' number is different from each other.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	No, not exactly because they have different locations and it is visible in their postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

I named business table as b, category table as c; hours table as h to make them understandable.

SELECT b.name
, b.city
, c.category
, b.stars
,h.hours,
b.review_count,
b.address,
b.postal_code
FROM (business as b INNER JOIN category as c ON b.id = c.business_id) 
INNER JOIN hours as h ON h.business_id = b.id
WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Pubs'
GROUP BY b.stars;
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The ones which is open's average review count is more than the one which is closed.
+---------------+---------+
|      avgStars | is_open |
+---------------+---------+
| 3.66393442623 |       0 |
| 3.89982578397 |       1 |
+---------------+---------+
         
ii. Difference 2:
	The average star rating is higher for the ones that is open than the ones that is closed.
+---------------+---------+
|      avgStars | is_open |
+---------------+---------+
| 3.66393442623 |       0 |
| 3.89982578397 |       1 |
+---------------+---------+
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(distinct(b.id)),b.city,c.category,
	   AVG(b.review_count) as avgReview,
	   AVG(b.stars) as avgStars,
	   is_open
FROM business as b
inner join category as c on c.business_id = b.id
GROUP BY b.is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I choose to make analysis on if there is a relation between star ratings and the number of branch on different types of categories.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	For my analysis I pick several different types of categories which are Bars,Pubs,Restaurants,Cafes,Beer Garden. To better understand whether there is a relation between start ratings and different categories' 
	number of branches,I focused on their star ratings, review counts, whether it is open or not and other specialities so that I can get some insights on there is a relation is exist or not.
	The reason that I choose this data is that clarifying there is no need to open a new branch to get more reviews or high star ratings.               
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+-------------+------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+
| category    | Number_Of_Branch |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) | is_open | city      |
+-------------+------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+
| Cafes       |                1 |           4.5 |              26.0 |       1 | Toronto   |
| Bars        |               17 |           3.5 |     77.7647058824 |       1 | Westlake  |
| Restaurants |               71 | 3.45774647887 |     63.4366197183 |       1 | Westlake  |
| Pubs        |                5 |           3.4 |              44.4 |       1 | Toronto   |
| Beer Garden |                1 |           3.0 |              50.0 |       1 | Stuttgart |
+-------------+------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+

         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS Number_Of_Branch
,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),is_open,b.city
FROM business as b 
INNER JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
WHERE c.category IN
('Bars','Pubs','Restaurants','Cafes','Beer Garden')
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC
